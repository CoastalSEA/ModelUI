%% ModelUI
% ModelUI is a generic interface for bespoke models and data analysis tools.

%% Requirements
% The code is provided as Open Source code (issued under a GNU General 
% Public License). It is written in MATLAB(TM) and requires v2016b, or later.

%% Background
% ModelUI provides a generic interface for modelling applications that produce 
% some combination of graphical and/or time series outputs. The purpose of this 
% user interface (UI) is to enable the rapid prototyping of models by allowing 
% the model developer to focus on the model, rather than the functional or operational 
% needs of the software package itself.  To this end, the UI provides a standard 
% interface with drop-down menus, tools to open and close files, keep track of model 
% runs, provide a rapid means to implement model set-up and data import and export, 
% derivation of new variables, and some basic plotting and statistical tools.
