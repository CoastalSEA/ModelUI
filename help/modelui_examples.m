%% ModelUI Examples
% A number of models are provided to illustrate a range of possible
% applications. The details of each model set-up are given in the 
% <matlab:open_manual manual>. The mat files for the demonstration models can be found in
% the DemoModels folder <matlab:demo_folder here>. The models are:
%%
% * Vertical Profile - model to compute vertical structure of tidal
% currents using several different eddy viscosity formulations.
% * Simple tide - a tide emulator to output a synthetic data set of
% elevations or velocities.
%%
% These models both use the default model interface. Models to illustrate
% the development of bespoke user interfaces are provided in the available
% to download from www.coastalsea.uk
